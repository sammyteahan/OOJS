## Objected Oriented Javascript

There are different kinds of objects when talking about js. One thing I never thought about was that all objects have two things in common. They all have state and behavior. The state refers to the condition of all values at a particular point in time (a radio can be on or off). The behavior is the defined functionality of the interface (the methods)

We'll refer to object variables as properties and functions as methods


###### JS native objects

* Number
* String
* Array
* Boolean
* Object
* etc


###### Host Objects

* document (browser)
* console (browser)
* element (browser)
* EventEmitter (node)


###### Program (developer created) objects
